# Take-Home Coding Challenge: Async Data Pipeline
## Overview
Build a concurrent data processing pipeline that fetches, processes, and stores data from multiple APIs. This task evaluates your skills in asynchronous programming, concurrency control, and error handling.
 
**Language:** Python
## The Challenge
Imagine you’re building a small data aggregation service that collects product information from multiple mock e-commerce APIs and processes them concurrently.
### Requirements
#### 1. Data Fetching (Async/Concurrent)
- Fetch product data from 3 different mock API endpoints (options provided below)
- Implement concurrent requests with proper rate limiting (max 5 requests/second per endpoint)
- Handle network timeouts and retries (max 3 retries with exponential backoff)
- Each endpoint returns 100+ products, paginated (20 items per page)
#### 2. Data Processing (Multithreading/Worker Pool)
- Process fetched data using a worker pool/thread pool
- Normalize product data from different APIs into a consistent format
- Calculate additional metrics (e.g., price trends, category distribution)
- Implement proper synchronization for shared data structures
#### 3. Error Handling & Resilience
- Gracefully handle API failures (some endpoints may be unreliable)
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints
- Log errors with appropriate detail levels
- Ensure partial failures don't crash the entire pipeline
#### 4. Performance & Monitoring
- Process all data within 60 seconds
- Implement basic monitoring (track success/failure rates, processing times)
- Memory-efficient processing (don't load all data into memory at once)
## Mock API Endpoints
**Important:** All endpoints should be treated as rate-limited (implement proper rate limiting in your solution).
You can choose from mock API providers like these options or create your own:
### Option 1: Free Testing APIs
```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts (treat as products)
https://reqres.in/api/users?page={page} (treat as product data - needs a free API key)
https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products (actual product data)
https://dummyjson.com/products (actual product data)
```
### Option 2: Create Local Mock Servers
You can create simple Flask/FastAPI mock servers that:
- Return paginated JSON data
- Simulate different response times
- Occasionally return errors (for testing resilience)
- Implement actual rate limiting
Choose the approach that best demonstrates your skills. Document your choice and reasoning.
## Expected Deliverables
### 1. Core Implementation
- Main pipeline orchestrator
- Async fetching module with rate limiting
- Worker pool for data processing
- Error handling and retry logic
### 2. Documentation
- README with setup and run instructions
- Code comments explaining concurrency decisions
- Brief architecture overview (1-2 paragraphs)
- **AI_USAGE.md** documenting AI tool usage (required)
### 3. Testing
- Unit tests for key components
- Integration test for the full pipeline
- Error scenario tests (network failures, malformed data)
### 4. Bonus Points (Optional)
- Configuration file for tuning concurrency parameters
- Simple CLI interface with progress indicators
- Metrics collection and basic reporting
- Docker containerization
## Technical Constraints
**Must demonstrate understanding of:**
- `asyncio` for async operations and concurrency control
- HTTP client libraries (`aiohttp`, `httpx`, or `requests` with threading)
- Worker pools/thread pools (`concurrent.futures`, `threading`, or async alternatives)
- Error handling, retries, and circuit breaker patterns
**Allowed libraries** (choose what's appropriate for your solution):
- HTTP clients: `aiohttp`, `httpx`, `requests`
- Retry/resilience: `tenacity`, `backoff`, or custom implementation
- Testing: `pytest`, `asyncio.test`, `unittest`
- CLI/progress: `click`, `typer`, `tqdm`, `rich`
- Data processing: `pandas` (if needed for complex analysis)
- Configuration: `pydantic`, `dataclasses`, or simple config files
**What to avoid:**
- Heavy frameworks that abstract away async concepts (e.g., Celery, complex ETL frameworks)
- Libraries that would make the core challenge trivial
**Library choice evaluation:**
- Document why you chose specific libraries in your README
- Explain alternatives you considered
- Show understanding of what the libraries provide vs. what you implemented
## AI Tool Usage Policy
**You are encouraged to use AI tools** (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) during this challenge, but with important requirements:
### Documentation Required
1. **AI Usage Log**: Create a file `AI_USAGE.md` documenting:
   - Which AI tools you used and when
   - Your exact prompts/questions to the AI
   - What code/solutions the AI provided
   - How you modified or adapted the AI's suggestions
2. **Decision Explanations**: For any AI-generated code you use:
   - Explain why you chose this approach
   - Describe what the code does in your own words
   - Note any modifications you made and why
   - Identify potential issues or limitations
### What We're Looking For
- **Understanding over copying**: You should be able to explain every line of code
- **Critical thinking**: Show that you evaluated AI suggestions rather than blindly accepting them
- **Personal judgment**: Demonstrate your own decision-making in choosing between options
- **Problem-solving process**: Document your thought process, not just the final solution
### Example AI Usage Entry
```
Prompt: How to implement exponential backoff in Python asyncio?
AI Response: [paste the AI's code suggestion]
My Analysis: The AI suggested ... I modified it ... I chose this approach because...
Final Implementation: [your adapted code with explanations]
```
This policy allows you to leverage modern development practices while demonstrating your understanding and judgment.
## Evaluation Criteria
We don’t expect a production-ready implementation. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of concurrency, async programming, and error handling. Partial but well-explained solutions are perfectly fine.
### Primary (70%)
1. **Correctness:** Does the solution work as specified?
4. **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, well-structured code
2. **Concurrency:** Proper use of async/threading patterns
3. **Error Handling:** Robust handling of failures and edge cases
### Secondary (30%)
1. **Performance:** Efficient resource usage and timing
2. **Testing:** Good test coverage and quality
3. **Documentation:** Clear explanations and setup instructions
4. **Best Practices:** Following language-specific conventions

  "summary": {
    "total_products": 300,
    "processing_time_seconds": 45.2,

      "title": "Product Name",
      "source": "endpoint_a",
      "price": 29.99,
      "category": "electronics",
      "processed_at": "2025-07-18T10:30:00Z"
    }
